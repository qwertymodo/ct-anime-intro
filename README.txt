Chrono Trigger MSU-1
Version 1.1
by DarkShock

This hack adds CD quality audio to Chrono Trigger using the MSU-1 chip invented by byuu.

The hack has been tested on bsnes-plus v073+1, higan 096 and SD2SNES. BSNES 070, 075 is NOT RECOMMENDED, use bsnes-plus v073.

For those playing on SD2SNES, you need to exit to menu using L+R+Select+X shortcut or hit the physical reset button on the console after saving in order to write the save back to the SD card.

Note they are two patches
- chrono_msu1.ips for emulators prior to higan v096 and SD2SNES without resume support
- chrono_msu1_resume.ips for higan v096 and up and SD2SNES with resume support

If you hate the fact that dungeon music restarts at the beginning with no-resume patch, delete chrono_msu1-69.pcm.

================
= Installation =
================
1. Buy Chrono Symphony album in FLAC format (http://www.thechronosymphony.com/). Extract them all to a folder.
2. Run convert_tracks.bat to create the music_pack
3. Create a copy of your original ROM named chrono_msu1.sfc
4. Patch the ROM using Lunar IPS or Floating IPS (http://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=78938)

Please support the original author of the album. I known some sites will host the complete music pack in PCM format, I do not endorse them at all.
